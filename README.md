# Diabetes Detection Model

## Overview
This project aims to predict the likelihood of diabetes in patients based on certain diagnostic measurements. The dataset used for training the model is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of medical predictor variables and one target variable, Outcome. Predictor variables include the number of pregnancies, BMI, insulin level, age, and others. All patients in the dataset are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.

## Model
The model was developed using Jupyter Notebook. It utilizes machine learning algorithms to predict the probability of diabetes in patients based on the provided diagnostic measurements.
